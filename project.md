## Abstract

Sentiment analysis is an evaluation of the opinion of the speaker, writer or other subject with regard to some topic.We are going to use US-elections dataset and combining the tweets of people opninon for leading presidential candidates. We have various datasets from kallage and combining tweets and NY times datasets, by combining all data predication will be dervied.

## 1. Introduction

For our final project, we will be focusing on the upcoming U.S. presidential elections. We plan to use a US-elections dataset to predict the votes each contestant will attain, by area. With growing data, the prediction will be changing constantly. We are making the difference by selecting the latest dataset available and previous election data to predict the number of votes each contestant will get to the closest figure. A feature we are introducing to enhance the quality is predicting various area types like counties, towns, and/or big cities.
One might argue that these kinds of predictions will only be helping organizations and not individuals. We assure you that this project will be helping the general public in many ways. The most evident being, an individual knowing which contestant his/her community or the general public around him/her prefer. This project is strictly statistical and does not have a goal to sway the elections in any way or to pressure an individual

 into picking a candidate. Overall, this is just a small step towards a future that might hold an environment where the next president of the United States of America could be accurately guessed based on previous data and innovative Big Data Technologies.

## 2. DataSets

We will be going to use the dataset, https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-elections-dataset, and we will create the filets based on location. If needed, we may download Twitter data from posts on and by Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and their associates. Which leads us to our objective for the project, based on the data we collected, we should be able to predict the winner of the 2020 United States of America’s presidential elections.

All of the data will be location-based and if required we will download realtime campaigning and debate analysis data, giving us a live and updated prediction every time increment. To strengthen the prediction, even more, we may reuse some code from the 2016 election’s analysis, however, our main focus will be using the latest data we readily acquire during the time leading up to the 2020 election.
In conclusion, to make our predictions as realistic and as strong as we can get, we will be going to choose multiple data sets to integrate between the previous election and twitter data to predict the number of votes each candidate will acquire. Therefore, we will be predicting the winner of the 2020 presidential elections.

## 3. Methodology/Process

We will collect election data and twitter information and integrate both to predict the results. A lot of twitter or dataset data will be trimmed and parsed to build the model. We will calculate
Our data-gathering and preparation methodology is composed of the following steps:

* Use the latest election dataset-2020, we will be creating the model.
 
* Data cleaning and extraction.
* We will try to download the latest data from twitter and campaigning.
